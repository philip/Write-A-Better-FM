\chapter{Maxims}

This isn't a chapter. This is a list of maxims. Each of these maxims
should become a chapter. Please feel free to grab one of them that
strikes your fancy, and write about it. Or add one.

\section{Find out who your audience is, and write to them. Hint: You are
not your audience.}

\section{Anticipate misconceptions, and gently correct}

\section{Strong leadership from an opinionated writer}

\section{Encourage customers to upgrade by showing them the advantages}

In the 1.3 docs, we should be telling folks ``this is easier in the 2.2
version''. In the 2.2 docs we usually shouldn't say ``here's how you
used to do it in version 1.2.17''.

\section{One working example teaches more than a page of theory}
